<p>The Scope of This Policy</p>

<p>This policy applies to all tyt users, including Riders and Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all tyt platforms and services, including our apps, websites, features, and other services (collectively, the &ldquo;tyt Platform&rdquo;). Please remember that your use of the tyt Platform is also subject to our Terms of Service.</p>

<p>The Information We Collect</p>

<p>When you use the tyt Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like third-party services, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:</p>

<p>A. Information You Provide to Us</p>

<p>Account Registration. When you create an account with tyt, we collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, and payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider profile, like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as your preferred pronouns).<br />
<br />
<strong>Driver Information.</strong> If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social security number), driver&rsquo;s license information, vehicle information, and car insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing numbers, and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and programs relevant to that location. We may need additional information from you at some point after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like a photo).<br />
<br />
<strong>Ratings and Feedback.</strong> When you rate and provide feedback about Riders or Drivers, we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback.<br />
<br />
<strong>Communications.</strong> When you contact us or we contact you, we collect any information that you provide, including the contents of the messages or attachments you send us.</p>

<p>B. Information We Collect When You Use the tyt Platform</p>

<p><strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The tyt Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending on your tyt app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:</p>

<ul>
<li>Riders: We collect your device&rsquo;s precise location when you open and use the tyt app, including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends. tyt also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.</li>
<li>Drivers: We collect your device&rsquo;s precise location when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your use of the tyt Platform, including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code. We also collect information about your interactions with the tyt Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.<br />
<br />
<strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access the tyt Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data).<br />
<br />
<strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either party&rsquo;s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the participants&rsquo; phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the tyt Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.<br />
<br />
<strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device permissions to grant tyt access to your contact lists and direct tyt to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to tyt. If you do this, we will access and store the names and contact information of the people in your address book.<br />
<br />
<strong>Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies.</strong> We collect information through the use of &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, tracking pixels, data analytics tools like Google Analytics, SDKs, and other third-party technologies to understand how you navigate through the tyt Platform and interact with tyt advertisements, to make your tyt experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use the tyt Platform. You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of the tyt Platform.</p>

<p>C. Information We Collect from Third Parties</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Services.</strong> Third-party services provide us with information needed for core aspects of the tyt Platform, as well as for additional services, programs, loyalty benefits, and promotions that can enhance your tyt experience.

<p>How We Share Your Information</p>

<p>We do not sell your personal information. To make the tyt Platform work, we may need to share your personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share your information.</p>

<p>A. Sharing Between tyt Users</p>

<p>Riders and Drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rider information shared with Driver:</strong> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Rider&rsquo;s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider&rsquo;s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the tyt app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider&rsquo;s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider&rsquo;s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Driver information shared with Rider:</strong> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver&rsquo;s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver&rsquo;s tyt profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).<br />
<br />
Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your consent.<br />
<br />
<strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a tyt Shared ride, we share each Rider&rsquo;s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other&rsquo;s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your tyt Business Profile account, a code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government), or a corporate credit card linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests or pays for a ride for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party, including the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.<br />
<br />
<strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the tyt Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the tyt Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the tyt Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information.</p>

<p>B. Sharing With Third-Party Service Providers for Business Purposes</p>

<li>Financial information, such as bank routing numbers, tax information, and any other payment information you provide us;</li>
<li>Commercial information, such as ride information, Driver/Rider statistics and feedback, and Driver/Rider transaction history;</li>
<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as your IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, carrier and/or manufacturer, device identifiers, and mobile advertising identifiers; and</li>
<li>Location data.</li>
</ul>

<p>We disclose those categories of personal information to service providers to fulfill the following business purposes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Processing or fulfilling rides;</li>

If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the &ldquo;Deleting Your Account&rdquo; section below.

But no security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information, including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.</p>

<p>A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act</p>

<p>The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. <strong>For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore or write to:</strong></p>

<p>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau<br />
1700 G Street NW, Washington, DC 20552</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment &ndash; or to take another adverse action against you &ndash; must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.</li>
<li>You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your &ldquo;file disclosure&rdquo;). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:
<ol>
<li>a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;</li>
<li>you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file;</li>
<li>your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud;</li>
<li>you are on public assistance;</li>
<li>you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.</li>
</ol>
In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore for additional information.</li>
<li>You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.</li>
<li>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore for an explanation of dispute procedures.</li>
<li>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.</li>
<li>Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.</li>
<li>Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need &ndash; usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.</li>
<li>You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</li>
<li>You may limit &ldquo;prescreened&rdquo; offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited &ldquo;prescreened&rdquo; offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-567-8688.</li>
<li>You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.</li>
<li>Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.</li>
</ul>

<p>States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General. For information about your federal rights, contact:</p>
